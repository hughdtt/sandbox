# Sandbox
Little playspace for me to store little snippets of code in. I've tried to categorize things so it's easy for both me and anyone else to look at.
Feel free to read/use/take as you wish. Disclaimer - this repository isn't something meant to be cloned and deployed. As such, I don't provide support for doing that.
From my knowledge, everything should work when you run it. If you're nice enough to spot a mistake and do a pull request, I might be around to see that it gets merged.
